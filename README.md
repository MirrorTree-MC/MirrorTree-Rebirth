# MirrorTree-Rebirth

This repository contains miscellaneous drafts during daily development of MirrorTree. It is made to better print those markdown files.

## Build

For building against the theme you need to install MkDocs via Pip (Python). To get started simply run the following:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you are using anaconda, you can also create a new environment with the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

To serve the documentation, run the serve command:

```bash
mkdocs serve
```
